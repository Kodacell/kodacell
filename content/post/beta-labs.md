A few weeks ago I got the opertunity to assist and help mentor at a week-long workshop for Artists, Film-makers and Fashion Designers who wanted to explore Virtual and Augmneted reality. Over the 5 days the group explored Virtual Reality, what it was capable of, how they might use it and also got the chance to make some of their own content. A mixture of 360Â° filmmaking, 3D
printing and exploring tools like Tiltbrush, Medium and Google Blocks were used throughout the week gave them everything that they needed to go away and start thinking. 

There were also several presentations throughout the week from Artists and fashion designers who came to talk about how they were exploring VR in their own work.
