On boxing day I began recieving some calls regarding something for sale on Craigslist that wasn't posted by myself. I received it a few times before I just blocked the number, but blocking the number from the device doesn't stop the person from continuing to call and leave voicemails. Its not the worst thing in the world, but it does just get annoying and if you know just a little bit of Python, something thats super easy to halt with a simple script and a twilio account.
