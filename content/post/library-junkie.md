Over the last few weeks I've had the task of attending interviews at a whole wide range of companies, from the small start-ups setting out to disrupt an industry, to the big
corporations who have 100s of developers on board churning out a wide range of applications. I will admit that it's not my favourite thing to do, interview that is, but it 
is always interesting to see what companies are doing. 

One thing that is probably pretty obvious to most people by now, especially if you've been a developer in the market any time in the last few years, React dominates. I've got an expansive spreadsheet where I have kept a log of every role I have been put forward for or applied for and React takes up a good 80% of it. Its not a comprehensive overview of every job that is out there, but it is one that I think very well represents the developer job market in the UK, especially in London. 

In the past 10 years I have seen frameworks and libraries come and go. Like many developers I know, I got my start with jQuery and to be a front end developer a few years ago, this was about all you needed to land a job in an ad-agency or equivilent circa 2009. That might not be true for 100% of places, but thats what I recognized back then. If you could write you're own jQuery plugins or a very small library that had a dependency on jQuery, you were in. There were of course much larger libraries at the time, ones that were more like frameworks, but very few people dove into them. 

## Library Junkie

I consider myself a pretty generalist developer. I've used at some point most of the popular libraries and frameworks in both personal and client projects. I have bits that I like about them all - I like the opinionated and standards based approach of Ember, I like using TYpescript by default on Angular and I like the simplicity of React - and I think in some places they all have their drawbacks, but the one thing that I don't do is attach myself to a library. Im not a {React, Angualr, Ember} Developer, Im just a developer who happens to have worked with all these tools. A blacksmith doesn't specialise in just using a single hammer or a technique - they might be better with the power hammer than they are with the grinder, but they never *just* use the single tool.
