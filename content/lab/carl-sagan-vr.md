The Carl Sagan VR experience was built as an entry to the Samsung Internet 'VR Together' [hackathon](https://samsunginter.net/vrtogether-entries/). It was an experiment 
for using audio and the timing of the audio to trigger various animations and also something closer to an 'experience'.

I would eventually like to add to it a bit more and include some more detail in the models etc.
